Interview Tips from Akshay on 25-12-2022:

1. (Brutally honest) In interviews, a lot of things depend on your luck.Why? 

Because, most companies don't spend time/resources to train their 

interviewers well.
2. A person can be a Good Software Engineer, but not good interviewer.
3. Luck - Can't Control

What can we control?
1. Our Preparation:
	a. 50% - Technical skills - everyone knows
	b. 50% - Communication Skills
		- speak your thoughts while you code
		   - practice this even when you are coding alone
		- if you can't explain, interviewer thinks you don't know.
		- you don't know work alone in company
		   - companies expect you to have good communication skills
		   - it's a brutal truth, you should know English.
		- mock interview
	c. Preparation on the Interview Day
		- you should not be hustling at last moment	
		- pen / paper
		- waterbottle
		- keep your camera open
		- keep your phone on silent
		- router UPS (power backup)
	d. CONFIDENCE COMES FROM PREPARATION
		(not just your technical preparation)
2. Just stay focussed, and don't panic. Even if interview goes wrong, it's 

OK.
