1. What is Emmet?
Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist.

2. What is CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

3. What is Cross-Origin?
The crossorigin attribute in HTML, is valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

4. What is the difference between async and defer?

a).From Akshay Saini's Video:

Without async/defer : Browser stops the html parsing once script tag is encountered. It resumes parsing only after script is fetched and executed. 

  Async : Html parsing is done in parallel while scripts are being fetched from the network and executed.
  Once the script is done with execution, html parsing is resumed. This can be used for external scripts like google analytics. 
  It is better to avoid async for scripts that are dependent on other scripts since we dont know in which order scripts will be executed.

  Defer : Similar to async, Html parsing is done in parallel while scripts are being fetched from the network. But scripts are executed only after the 
  html parsing is done.


b). Alternate Explanation:
async and defer are two keywords in JavaScript that allow you to create functions that run asynchronously.

    defer => defer is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important. 
    async => async is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads,and their relative execution order does not matter.

    async executes as soon as possible while defer runs in sequence toward the end of the loading process, just before the 
    DOMContentLoaded event.

    async:
        1. async is used for independent scripts
        2. Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as defer)
        3. Can interrupt page rendering to execute
        4. Executes as soon as possible and in no particular order

     =>  async is best for very high priority JavaScript resources that should run as early as possible in the loading process. 

    defer:
        1. Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as async)
        2. Won't interrupt page rendering to execute
        3. Executes in sequence just before the DOMContentLoaded event

     =>    defer is ideal for general JavaScript resources that aren't critical to the initial rendering of the page and can be run 
           later in the loading process.
